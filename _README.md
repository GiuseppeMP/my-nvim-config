# My nvim configs

<h1>README in WIP... NEED TO BE UPDATED</h1> 

Hello, I'm Giuseppe Matheus (Beppe) a software engineer from Brazil. 👋

I have created this configuration to assist others in achieving a complete workflow using Neovim.

I have experimented with NvChad, Alpha, and other configurations, but I consistently face the same issue: I find it difficult to comprehend their configuration structure, and I feel incapable of making modifications without thoroughly studying the documentation on how things are structured. Additionally, it is challenging to determine the functions of each plugin.

In the past, I have written numerous configuration files, but now I would like to share my experience with you. My aim is to keep things as simple as possible, allowing any user familiar with Lua and Neovim to make changes without excessive abstraction.

All the configurations of plugins are present in the /lua/plugins folder, each .lua file in there is a atomic plugin configuration.

I work daily using this configuration with Python, Java, Kotlin, Lua, Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, YAML, JSON, XML, Markdown, Terraform, Ansible, and Shell.

Let me know if you have any questions, other lsp help, or suggestions, free to [open an issue](https://github.com/GiuseppeMP/my-nvim-config/issues/new).

## ⚠️  Breaking Changes!!

Java configurations have changed, please check the new instructions in Java section in the {your-os}_install.md.
[ubuntu-java](https://github.com/GiuseppeMP/my-nvim-config/blob/main/ubuntu_install.md#java)
[macos-java](https://github.com/GiuseppeMP/my-nvim-config/blob/main/macos_install.md#java)

Now `jdtls` configuration is using os.env to get java runtimes from environment variables. ($JAVA_HOME, $JAVA8_HOME, $JAVA11_HOME, $JAVA17_HOME, so on).
